      <li>MY STORY</li>

       <p>I've been a video editor since I was 15 years old and has always been a passion of mines. I ended up joining the us army to be able to afford film school and was two terms shy of graduating until I developed an interest in software development. I'll always love filmmaking but I do not need a degree in that field and I been doing it so long I wanted to give something new a try.</p>

      <li>MY TIME IN THE MILITARY</li>

      <p>Joining the military was something that was never in my plans when I was young. A lot of different factors lead down the path to joining the US Army but I believe it was an incredible choice to make in my life and has opened so many doors that I would have never had, had I not joined. There were many times when I felt regret in making the decision to join but deciding to push through the military has improved my life so much and I have met some incredible life long friends during my time in service.</p>

      <li>MY PLANS AS A SOFTWARE DEVELOPER </li>

      <p>I've always been interested computer and was the tech guy in my family even at a very young age I just wasn't aware you could have a career path in it or believed you'd have to be Albert Einstein to be able to figure out how to code. After doing research for a year I decided to make the leap and join the Code Fellows software development program. I've also applied to WGU and plan to do that while I'm searching for work and whenever I'm hired in order to be able give my career the best chance possible. I'm very optimistic even though the program at Code Fellows is very challenging.</p>
